# .MSI Sneak Attack
List and remove those hard to clean .MSI installs!

Sometimes it's hard to find information about the .MSI's installed on your machine, and even harder to actually remove the install.

Try this utility - a very simple grid of installed MSI information, and trigger an uninstall by deleting a row from the grid.

Use at your own risk!
